# Programming Languages Enhancement Plan

## Objective
Add comprehensive programming language support to enhance the Game Center with multi-language game development capabilities.

## Languages to Add
1. **C++ (.cpp, .h)** - Game engines and performance-critical components
2. **C (.c)** - System-level game components
3. **D (.d)** - Modern game development with better performance
4. **C# (.cs)** - Unity game development and Windows games
5. **SQL (.sql)** - Game databases and data management
6. **PHP (.php)** - Game servers and web-based game logic
7. **Fortran (.i)** - Scientific computing and game physics
