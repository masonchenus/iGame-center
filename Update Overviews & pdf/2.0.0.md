# Game Center Version 2.0.0

**Release Date:** December 21, 2025

## Purpose

iGame-center is a browser-based game platform that tracks player progress, scores, and achievements. It provides a centralized hub for players to play games, view stats, and compete globally.

## Core Components

- **index.html** — Main game interface where players play the game.
- **scoreboard.html** — Displays global scores and player rankings.
- **gamercard.html** — Shows detailed player stats and achievements.
- **src/core/** — Contains all frontend code (HTML, JS, CSS) that runs in the browser.

## Backend / Data Handling

- **GraphQL API** (via server.js and graphql/) handles storing and querying scores and achievements. It allows the frontend to retrieve exactly the data it needs.
- **In-memory storage** (currently in graphql/data.js) temporarily stores scores and achievements; can be upgraded to a database later.

## Features

- Global Score Tracking — Players' scores are tracked and displayed on a leaderboard.
- Gamercard System — Personalized player stats.
- Achievements — Planned for future updates (2.1+).
- Update Logging — Optional documentation using `.tex` files for changelogs.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js + Apollo Server
- **API:** GraphQL
- **Storage:** In-memory JS arrays (future: database)
- **Optional:** TeX (`.tex` files) for update overviews or documentation

## Workflow Overview

1. Player plays game on **index.html**.
2. Score is sent via GraphQL mutation to backend.
3. Backend stores the score.
4. **scoreboard.html** queries backend via GraphQL to show updated leaderboard.
5. Gamercard queries backend to display stats and achievements.
6. Updates can be documented in `.tex` files for professional changelogs.
